# Welcome to 'Scrabbling Java with CC'!
We welcome you to our project where you can contribute to the project by using Collection Classes and Interfaces of our very favorite computer language **JAVA**. 
This project is simple and easy so that we can help those who are contributing for the first time. Hence, this project also serves as an experience for *'First Time Contributors'* 



# The Project 

The project is like your very own repository where you can add programs and code related to the different **collection classes** & **collection interfaces** defined in JAVA.  The contributor has to send in code files by applying and using different java collection classes and interfaces methods as per the list mentioned below. 

We will then be reviewing and adding your code files under the respective method headings. 

## The Collection Interface list:  
List Interface  
Queue Interface  
Deque Interface  
Set Interface  
Map Interface  
SortedSet Interface  
NavigableSet Interface  

## The Collection Class list:  
ArrayList Class  
Vector Class  
Linkedlist Class  
PriorityQueue Class  
ArrayDeque Class  
HashSet Class  
LinkedHashSet Class  
HashMap Class  
TreeSet Class  


# Contribution best practices

## For First time Contributors 
Kindly read the CONTRIBUTE.md file first to know some basic git commands and the proper way to create issue and send pull requests. 

## Branch Policy 
To make things easy for all of us we are as of now having only one branch that is the ***master branch*** hence you need to make pull request to the master branch only. 

## Code Practices 
'With good code practices come efficiency' hence we would like you to follow some code practices -

- Try making single commit per pull request, 
- Try using decent commit messages by following the COMMITSTYLE convention. 

Please help us follow the best practices to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor.
